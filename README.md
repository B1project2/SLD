# Sign Language Detection: An add on feature over Video-conferencing Platforms 

In this era, where inclusivity and sense of equality are considered a basic necessity for all. But this gets challenged when an individual who is fluent in sign and uses it to communicate with someone who isn’t. We often take our ability to interact with others for granted. More than 70 million around the world uses sign language. But significant barriers to communicating in sign language are depriving these specially-abled people to enjoy even basic interaction with others. Although deaf and mute people can settle everything in writing, but there might be such situations where the corporation of manual sign language interpreters becomes a necessity. Hiring a translator can be exorbitant. The objective of this project is to tear down this communication barrier a bit without having to learn sign explicitly or need an interpreter.

People seem unaware of what being mute entails, we guess that’s because in a world where the majority of people can speak it’s not something most people can really emphasize with. The hardest part for them is how some people assume that having a disability means that these people are not capable enough to study or work. Therefore, they are considered as aloof and are always left out. They are still a person; they just can’t speak but are as capable as a normal person.

Rather than sympathizing over their situation, easing down their communication struggle is least we can do and this is what they would expect from us.
We are all witnessing how technology is fundamentally changing the way we live, work and relate to one another and to the external world. Now more than ever, the advent of AI technology has the potential to transform one’s life. Why not use the emerging ML technology to tear down the struggles of mute people. 

Just like how we use to match pictures with their respective names in our kindergarten classes. Using the same concept, we thought of matching the signs to their respective meaning, but making it more accessible by detecting the gestures in real time and then displaying their correct label. And thereby proposing this sign language recognition feature to be scaled over video conferencing platform. This will increase the usability as well as participation of mute population.
